      <p>
        Front-end web development is the development of the graphical user
        interface of a website through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so
        users can view and interact with that website

      HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website
      development process, without which a web page does not exist. Hypertext
      means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user
      clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another
      web-page. A markup language indicates text can be turned into images,
      tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that
      provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was
      developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5
      and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3C recommendation. This
      version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video
      and audio files.

      <h3>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the
        site and allows your site to have its own unique look. It does this by
        maintaining style sheets that sit on top of other style rules and are
        triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and
        resolution. The CSS can be added either externally, internally, or
        embedded in the HTML tags.[6]

      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed
        to HTML's declarative language model) that is used to transform a static
        HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use the Document
        Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web
        page in response to events, like user input. Using a technique called
        AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web
        (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to
        server-side events as well, adding a truly dynamic nature to the web
        page experience.

      <h3>WebAssembly</h3>
      <p>
        WebAssembly, supported by all the major browsers (i.e. from the major
        vendors Google, Apple, Mozilla and Microsoft), is the only alternative
        to JavaScript for running code in web browsers (without the help of
        plug-ins, such as Flash, Java or Silverlight; all being discontinued, as
        browsers are dropping plug-in support). Prior to its adoption, there was
        asm.js (a subset of JavaScript; and thus strictly works in all
        browsers), that's also used as a compiler target with efficient support
        in browsers such as Internet Explorer 11; and for such browsers that do
        not support WebAssembly directly, it can be compiled to asm.js and those
        browsers supported that way. Generally speaking programmers do not
        program in WebAssembly (or asm.js) directly, but use languages such as
        Rust, C or C++ or in theory any language, that compile to it.
